# Data Overview 101

Below is a short overview of the collections and reporting products that AOE performs, with links to more resources about them.

## Collections

### [Statewide Longitudinal Data System](https://education.vermont.gov/data-and-reporting/statewide-longitudinal-data-system)
The SLDS is intended to enhance the ability of Vermont to efficiently and accurately manage,
analyze, and use education data. The SLDS should help all Vermont education stakeholders to
make data-informed decisions to improve student learning and outcomes; as well as to facilitate
research to increase student achievement and close achievement gaps.

### [Child Count](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/data-collection-child-count-reporting-instructions)
The Vermont Agency of Education uses the Child Count Collection and the Exiting Collection
to report data for children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 to the U.S. Department of
Education in accordance with Section 618 of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (IDEA). Other uses of Child Count data include public reporting, special education funding
calculations, and Annual Performance Reports.

### [Early Childhood Assessment](https://education.vermont.gov/student-support/early-education/assessment)
Early childhood assessments consist of TSgold gold assessment done in the fall and spring of
each PreK Year. Also, in the fall of the kindergarten year teachers complete the Ready for
Kindergarten Survey.

### [EL Primary Home Language Survey](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/federal-programs-primary-home-language-survey)
Information is collected on English Learners through this tool for many state and federal
reporting requirements.

## Reporting Products:

### [ESSA Annual Snapshot](https://schoolsnapshot.vermont.gov/)
The Annual Snapshot is an online tool where you can find quantitative data about Vermont
schools. You can see how your school, Supervisory Union/District or the state is doing, based on
measures Vermont has decided are important. The Annual Snapshot exists to support schools,
not rank them. The goal of the Annual Snapshot is to encourage communities to work together
to improve educational outcomes for all students.

### [ACT 166 PreK Evaluation Report](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/legislative-report-prek-annual-evaluation-2019)
As part of the ongoing monitoring effort for the Universal Prekindergarten program a
legislative report is prepared which highlights key outcomes and equity issues for students. In
addition many of the elements reporting out here also are reflected in Vermont’s profile for the
National institute of Early Education Research (NIEER) yearbook report PreK Yearbook.

### [Vermont Education Dashboard](https://education.vermont.gov/data-and-reporting/vermont-education-dashboard)
During each fiscal year, the Agency of Education collects data from Vermont's supervisory
unions and school districts about students, staff, enrollment and assessments. The data collected
help inform us, schools, educators and taxpayers about the functionality and success of
Vermont's education system.

### [Special Education Reports](https://education.vermont.gov/data-and-reporting/school-reports/special-education-reports)
This page on the Vermont Agency of Education website holds state and local Annual Performance
Reports, public reporting of Child Count data by district, and fiscal reports on special education
spending.

### [EDFacts Reports](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/index.html)
The main way that states are required to report data to the US Department of Education is through
EdFacts files. The federal EDFacts Initiative collects, analyzes, and promotes the use of high-quality
pre-kindergarten through grade 12 data nationwide.

### [CSPR](https://oese.ed.gov/offices/office-of-administration/about-us/consolidated-state-performance-reports/)
This is the state’s application for federal funds populated largely by EdFacts files.

### [Ready For Kindergarten Report](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/edu-early-education-ready-for-kindergarten-report-2018-2019)
Since 2000, Vermont has gathered information on the readiness of students entering
kindergarten by surveying kindergarten teachers about their students’ knowledge and skills
within the first six to ten weeks of school.

##  GLOSSARY

1. **Access 4 Learning (A4L) Community:** Previously known as the SIF Association, the Access 4
    Learning Community is a non-profit collaboration composed of schools, districts, local authorities,
    states, US and International Ministries of Education, software vendors and consultants who
    collectively address all aspects of learning information management and access to support learning.
    This community is responsible for managing and expanding the “SIF” specifications.
2. **Average Daily Membership (ADM):** Average Daily Membership (ADM) is a count of resident
    and state-placed students who receive an elementary or secondary education at public expense; data
    are listed by town according to a student’s residence. Resident students are counted during the
    period from the 11th to the 30th day of the current school year, while state-placed students are
    counted for the school year prior to the current census period. Data are used in calculating equalized
    pupils which are used to determine the homestead tax rates.
3. **Codeset:** A list of allowable values that may be submitted in a data element.
4. **Composite Primary Keys:** A combination of two or more elements in a submission that, taken
    together, uniquely identify a single row or record. This determines the ‘granularity’ of the data.
    (Note: All submissions use composite primary keys versus a single primary key.)
5. **Data Collection:** A collection of one or more predefined groupings of submissions to the state via a
    vertical reporting mechanism.
6. **Data Element:** A specific field in which data is collected.
7. Granularity: The level of detail of a set of detail. Granularity for a submission is defined by the
    composite primary keys of a submission.
8. **Local Data Reporting Manager:** For the purpose of this document, local data reporting manager
    refers to the person(s) responsible for managing the data in the local student information system.
    This person should be an expert on the data within the system. This includes understanding how the
    data elements are defined, primary key usage and knowledge of codesets and reporting requirements.
10. **Official Data Collection:** A data collection that is implemented with more stringent business rules
    (than unofficial collections) because the data will be used for required state or federal reporting.
