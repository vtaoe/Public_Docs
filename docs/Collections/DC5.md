## Reporting Instructions


### Completing the DC5 Tuitioned Student Official data submission

The DC5 Tuitioned Student Official is a list of students in the Vermont educational system with a specific set of information about each student, formally known as the tuitioned student census. This data collection allows the AOE to satisfy many state and federal reporting requirements.

Use of this collection is to report the names of students enrolled in independent schools or out-of-state schools for whom one of your school districts pays tuition. This information will be used in calculating an ADM for your town districts.

### Who belongs in Your Submission?

#### Students to include in your submission

- Any student enrolled in a Vermont approved independent school, Vermont Private Academy or out of state school at a school district&#39;s expense. Please include all students who were enrolled at any point during the 20-day ADM census period. These are students listed on tuition bills submitted from these schools.

#### Students who are NOT on your census

- Tuitioned students attending public schools. We will receive information about these students from the DC#06\_FALL\_ADM\_Official collection.

#### Confidentiality Issues to Consider

This data submission contains confidential information about students. Accordingly, the VT Agency of Education adheres to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) - 34 C.F.R. Section 99.31. FERPA allows for the collection of data required to do the work of state and educational agencies. The principle of confidentiality underlies all policies and procedures for the collection, maintenance, disclosure and destruction of education records. Schools and districts also have a responsibility to protect the confidentiality of student records. Please be sure that proper policies and procedures are in place, and followed, to successfully complete this data submission.

Please do not email identifiable student information to the AOE.

### [16 V.S.A. § 1075](https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/16/025/01075). Legal residence defined; responsibility and payment of education of pupils

> (a) For the purpose of this title, except as otherwise set forth, the legal residence or residence of a student shall be as follows:
> 
> (1) In the case of a minor, legal residence is where his or her parents reside, except that:
> 
> (A) if the parents live apart, legal residence is where either parent resides, but if a parent with sole custody lives outside the State of Vermont, the student does not have a legal residence in Vermont;
> 
> (B) if the minor is in the custody of a legal guardian appointed by a Vermont court or a court of competent jurisdiction in another state, territory, or country, legal residence is where the guardian resides.
> 
> (2) In the case of a student who has reached the age of majority, legal residence is where the student resides.
> 
> (3) For the purposes of this title, &quot;resident&quot; of the State and of a school district means a natural person who is domiciled in the school district and who, if temporarily absent, demonstrates an intent to maintain a principal dwelling place in the school district indefinitely and to return there, coupled with an act or acts consistent with that intent. The term &quot;temporarily absent&quot; includes those special cases listed in 17 V.S.A. § 2122(a). The term &quot;residence&quot; is synonymous with the term &quot;domicile.&quot; A married person may have a domicile independent of the domicile of his or her spouse. If a person removes to another town with the intention of remaining there indefinitely, that person shall be considered to have lost residence in the town in which the person originally resided even though the person intends to return at some future time. A person may have only one residence at a given time.

> (b) The Secretary shall determine the legal residence of all State-placed students pursuant to the provisions of this section. In all other cases, the student&#39;s legal residence shall be determined by the school board of the district in which the student is seeking enrollment or, if the student is seeking payment of tuition, the school board from which the student is seeking tuition payment. If a student is denied enrollment at any stage, the student and his or her parent or guardian shall be notified in writing, within 24 hours, of the provisions of this section. If the student is not in attendance as a result of a preliminary decision by school officials and a decision from the school board will not be available by the end of the second school day after the request for enrollment is made, the Secretary may issue a temporary order requiring enrollment. Any interested person or taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the school board as to the student&#39;s legal residence may appeal to the Secretary, who shall determine the student&#39;s legal residence, and the decision of the Secretary shall be final. Pending appeal under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue a temporary order requiring enrollment.

> 
> (5) If a student who had been a State-placed student pursuant to subdivision 11(a)(28) of this title is returned to live in the district in which one or more of the student&#39;s parents or legal guardians reside, then, at the request of the student&#39;s parent or legal guardian, the Secretary may order the student to continue his or her enrollment for the remainder of the academic year in the district in which the student resided prior to returning to the parent&#39;s or guardian&#39;s district and the student will continue to be funded as a State-placed student.
