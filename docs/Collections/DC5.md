## Reporting Instructions


### Completing the DC5 Tuitioned Student Official data submission

The DC5 Tuitioned Student Official is a list of students in the Vermont educational system with a specific set of information about each student, formally known as the tuitioned student census. This data collection allows the AOE to satisfy many state and federal reporting requirements.

Use of this collection is to report the names of students enrolled in independent schools or out-of-state schools for whom one of your school districts pays tuition. This information will be used in calculating an ADM for your town districts.

### Who belongs in Your Submission?

#### Students to include in your submission

- Any student enrolled in a Vermont approved independent school, Vermont Private Academy or out of state school at a school district&#39;s expense. Please include all students who were enrolled at any point during the 20-day ADM census period. These are students listed on tuition bills submitted from these schools.

#### Students who are NOT on your census

- Tuitioned students attending public schools. We will receive information about these students from the DC#06\_FALL\_ADM\_Official collection.

#### Confidentiality Issues to Consider

This data submission contains confidential information about students. Accordingly, the VT Agency of Education adheres to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) - 34 C.F.R. Section 99.31. FERPA allows for the collection of data required to do the work of state and educational agencies. The principle of confidentiality underlies all policies and procedures for the collection, maintenance, disclosure and destruction of education records. Schools and districts also have a responsibility to protect the confidentiality of student records. Please be sure that proper policies and procedures are in place, and followed, to successfully complete this data submission.

Please do not email identifiable student information to the AOE.

>

The term &quot;temporarily absent&quot; includes those special cases listed in 17 V.S.A. ยง 2122(a). The term &quot;residence&quot; is synonymous with the term &quot;domicile.&quot; A married person may have a domicile independent of the domicile of his or her spouse.

A person may have only one residence at a given time.

In all other cases, the student&#39;s legal residence shall be determined by the school board of the district in which the student is seeking enrollment or, if the student is seeking payment of tuition, the school board from which the student is seeking tuition payment.

Any interested person or taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the school board as to the student&#39;s legal residence may appeal to the Secretary, who shall determine the student&#39;s legal residence, and the decision of the Secretary shall be final. Pending appeal under this subsection, the Secretary shall issue a temporary order requiring enrollment.
