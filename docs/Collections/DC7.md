## Introduction

Since educator statistics (including the percentage of teachers not meeting licensure requirements for their assigned grade level and subject area) are compiled for your local education agency (LEA) based on the information submitted in the VT SLDS VR datasets, every effort should be made to complete the datasets accurately. LEAs are required to publicly report these statistics every year. In addition, educator licensing statistics are included in required public and federal reporting by the state. 

The information we request and the way it should be reported have beenis designed to provide the specific information required for local, state and federal public reporting. Reporting errors can result in the calculation of incorrect percentages of classes being taught by teachers who are not fully licensed for their grade level and subject area.  

The Vermont Agency of Education uses the course category assigned to an educator's courses to determine if the educator's grade level and subject area assignment meets licensing requirements. The assignment is then matched with the endorsements held by the educator as contained in our databases in order to determine whether the class is being taught by an educator who is appropriately licensed for that grade level and subject area. 

**Note:** It is the responsibility of the Supervisory Union/LEA to attain and maintain records regarding teachers who do not meet applicable State certification or licensure requirements at the grade level and subject area in which the teacher has been assigned. For more information about Supervisory Union/District/LEA responsibilities and accountability see the Transitioning to the [Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Frequently Asked Questions](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/essa/essafaqstransition62916.pdf).
