## Elementary/Secondary School Register

The Vermont School Register is a student record-keeping document required by Vermont statute. The purpose of the school register is to document each of Vermont school's continuous year-to-year cycle of enrolling students, to record daily attendance, to report dropouts and graduates, and to report year-end attendance to the Agency of Education. It is the source document for calculating Average Daily Membership, which is a critical aspect in the state funding system.
