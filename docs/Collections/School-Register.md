## SCHOOL YEAR 2020 - 2021
Revised June 2020

[[_TOC_]]


## Preface Contents

The Vermont School Register is a student record-keeping document required by Vermont
Statute (see Appendix B). The purpose of the school register is to document each Vermont
school’s continuous year-to-year cycle of enrolling students, to record daily attendance, to
report dropouts and graduates, and to report year-end attendance to the Agency of education.
It is the source document for calculating Average Daily Membership, which is a critical aspect
in the state funding system. Beginning in 2018 the mechanism for transferring this information
to the Agency of Education will be the Statewide Longitudinal Data System (VT SLDS), which
will collect data throughout the school year.

In Vermont, students of compulsory age are expected to be members of a school or acceptable
educational program. A student must be enrolled elsewhere if he or she leave their current
school or educational program. This concept of continuous enrollment has always been
included in the school register. The Student Census (DC#06 Fall ADM Official and DC#04 Year
End), which will be incorporated into the VT SLDS, documents the entry of students into the
school system, their continuous enrollment from one school to another within Vermont and/or
their transfer out of the Vermont Public School System. Each student must be enrolled on a
register whether the student attends that first day of school. Once a child is enrolled in the
school system, it is the school district’s responsibility at the beginning of the year to account for
each who was enrolled on the last day of school the previous year. Within ten days of the start
of each school year, the register must show that each student from the previous year is
attending, absent for a specific reason, has transferred, is receiving an approved alternate form
of instruction or has dropped out of the school system.

The Vermont School Register consist of a list of students and student information. This
information serves as a public record and should be maintained as such. Schools are expected
to maintain a computerized student information system.

## CHAPTER ONE: THE VERMONT SCHOOL REGISTER

### 1.1 Introduction

Vermont Education Statute requires each Vermont public school to maintain a Vermont School
Register. The purpose of the school register is to record each student’s participation in an
approved program of instruction.

Each school must keep an enrollment record of the students who enroll, transfer, withdraw, and
drop out of the required program of instruction. Each school must also keep a daily record of
attendance, excused absences, and unexcused absences of each enrolled student. Beginning in
the 2013-2014 school year the school register must include course offerings along with educators
teaching courses.

Collecting and reporting accurate daily register data for enrollment and attendance is important
becaus e it affects each school district’s funding. Th e Agency of Education (AOE) collects data
for critical reporting purposes from the Census/VT SLDS twice during each school year (Fall
and Summer) and will continue to do so using the new VT SLDS in 2021.

The first collection, the DC#06 Fall ADM Official collection, includes a list of all enrollment
instances from the beginning of the school year (July 1) through about November 10. The
DC#06 Fall_ADM Official collection includes information about the school and each student
that allows the AOE to calculate the Average Daily Membership (ADM) for all Vermont
Districts. The ADM is a critical component in the state funding system. This collection also
allows the AOE to create the October 1 count of students used in federal reporting and
allocations of state and federal grants.

The second collection of School Register data by the VT SLDS, is the DC#04 YearEndCollection.
It is collected at the end of each school year, due to be reported by August 14. With Vertical
Reporting in the VT SLDS, the attendance record and updates to enrollment can be reported
throughout the year with unofficial data submissions (DC#03 Nightly Collection Unofficial)
through Virtual Reporting (VR) but will be required as part of the official DC#
YearEndCollection. The attendance data are used for calculating a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)
for each student. The FTE is used to determine each school district’s tuition rates for students
attending from another school district and per pupil spending for annual AOE reports. In
addition, the DC#04 YearEndCollection determines each student’s classification at the end of
the year allowing the AOE to calculate attendance rates, retention rates, as well as graduation
rates that are part of Vermont’s statewide accountability system.

In addition to the VT SLDS official data reporting, schools must maintain records on courses
offered by the school. This course information includes educators providing instructional
services, student enrolled in course, and student outcomes including credits earned and marks.
This course information is reported to the AOE at the end of the school year in the DC#
YearEndCollection. Information received in this collection will be used to develop a state-wide
student transcript data repository to facilitate the transfer of student information for students
transferring between schools in Vermont. I t also serves as the data set used to explore course-
taking patterns as an indicator of how well schools are preparing students for post-secondary
success, evaluation of equity of access to opportunities, and as well as for examination of
student performance.

### 1.2 Overview of the School Register

The school register is a record of the continuous year-to-year cycle: enrolling or re-entering
students, recording daily attendance and absences, tracking when students leave a school,
reporting dropouts, and year-end attendance to the AOE.

The school register may be used in each classroom or in a designated central location for all
classrooms. Enrollment and attendance information must be updated daily, with summaries
compiled for each student at the end of the school year. Schools are expected to maintain a

computerized school register, or student information system that must meet the requirements of
the school register as specified in this document and data collection reporting instructions.

The concept of continuous enrollment is the basis of the school register. According to this
concept, students are enrolled in the school system one time and schools must track their
continuous enrollment from one school to another. After the original entry in the school
register (usually pre-kindergarten or kindergarten), a student is maintained on that school’s
register until they leave that school. Each student must be enrolled on a register on the first day
of school whether the student attends that day.

Continuous enrollment means that once a child is enrolled in the school, it is the school’s
responsibility at the beginning of the year to account for each student who was enrolled on the
last day of school the previous year. Within ten school days from the start of each school year,
the register must show that each student from the previous year is attending, absent for a
specific reason, has transferred, is receiving an approved alternate form of instruction or has
dropped out of the school system.

Similarly, schools are now expected to track the enrollment of students in specific classes, the
status, and the outcome of each course. A class is a particular section of a course offered at the
school.

## 1.3 Register Requirements

### 1.3.1 The Schools

Any school within a supervisory union/school district submitting the Fall_ADM_Collection
must maintain a Vermont public school register.

### 1.3.2 The Students

The majority of students on a school register are students who attend classes, full time, at that
school. Students who attend a different school (public or independent) full time are not
included on the register even if the student is a legal resident of the district operating the school,
(except in the circumstances described below).

In addition, students who take classes but are not expected to attend all day, every day at the
school, are enrolled as part-time students. This includes students who are enrolled in a home
study program or an independent school and who also take academic classes at a public school.
Students enrolled in a home study program using the school’s facilities for co-curricular or
extra-curricular activities are not part-time students. These students are included in the
enrollment recorded (and the VT SLDS Fall_ADM_Collection, and YearEndCollection vertical
reporting), but they do not contribute to a school’s enrollment and their attendance is not
recorded.

There are a few instances where students are on a school register without attending classes at
that school. In these cases, the school or program where the students receive their education is
required to submit the attendance and absence information to the “base” school. For instance,

technical centers must keep separate registers, but the students are considered enrolled in a
separate high school or base school. The attendance of students should either be taken at the
base school before transportation to the technical center, or the attendance taken at the technical
center should be reported back to the base school. A similar situation exists for students
attending Diversified Occupation Programs or temporarily placed in a tutorial or treatment
program. The base school refers to the school providing transportation or in the case where no
transportation is provided the base school refers to the school operated by the same district as
the technical center.

Students enrolled in summer classes only are not included in the register and any summer
school attendances are not recorded in the register or reported in the VT SLDS Vertical
Reporting.

If you are unsure about whether a particular student should be reported on your register, please
contact the AOE helpdesk at 802- 828 - 1064.

## 1.4 Instruction for Completing the Register

### 1.4.1 Identification Page

To complete the Official Identification page, please provide the information requested
including: the grade levels served, the identity of the registrar, principal(s) and
superintendent(s) names and information about the school calendar. The identification page
should be dated and signed by the school registrar and the superintendent.

### 1.4.2 Lists

The Public School Register includes a list of fire drills, certified personnel, and students. The
Public School Register will serve as the public record for your school and should be presented
to the superintendent by the registrar before July 15.

### 1.4.3 The Daily Record of Attendance

The AOE requires that all schools maintain a computerized enrollment and attendance record.
The attendance record does not need to be a part of the archived Public School Register pages.

It is expected that a school will use a separate attendance record for each program type. The
school is allowed to set up the Attendance record in a manner that suits its particular needs.
The following is a list of allowable grade or program codes (see Glossary for more information)




| Code | Grade  |
| -- | -- |
| IT | Infant and Toddlers | 
| EE | Early Essential Education | 
| PK | Pre-Kindergarten | 
| KF | Kindergarten-Full-Time | 
| KP | Kindergarten-Part-Time |
| 01 | Grade 1 |
| 02 | Grade 2 | 
| 03 | Grade 3 | 
| 04 | Grade 4 |
| 05 | Grade 5 |
| 06 | Grade 6 |
| 07 | Grade 7 |
| 08 | Grade 8 |
| 09 | Grade 9 |
| 10 | Grade 10 |
| 11 | Grade 11 |
| 12 | Grade 12 |
| AW | Adult without Diploma |
| PD | Postgraduate or Adult with Diploma

## 1.5 General Rules

1) The purpose of the register is to record each student’s school participation from the date of
entry to an official exit from school. This documentation of these changes includes events
such as transfer to another school, discontinuing schooling, and receiving high school
diplomas.
2) Schools must record the enrollment and attendance of students who are engaged in
educational activities away from the school. These activities may include home or hospital
tutoring provided by school personnel, a page participating in the legislature, students
participating in off-site flexible pathway (ACT 77) experiences such as dual enrollment or
work-based learning, technical center students, or temporary alternate placements.
3) A student may be entered in more than one school register in a given school year but must
only be officially enrolled in one register at a time. For example, students attending two
schools part-time or one school full-time and another school part-time can only be officially
enrolled in one school. The second school would record the student as receiving services
but enrolled in another school (see Section 2.1.1). Both schools should record the
attendances and absences used to create the FTE for these students. In addition, the part-
time information is used for calculating ADM.
4) A school must record enrollment and attendance data on a computerized register providing
the computer program meets the requirements of the VT SLDS Vertical Reporting.
5) High schools are expected to identify students who are attending their school through the
Public High School Choice formally known as Act 150 school choice. The sending school
will not report students who transferred to another high school through Public High School
Choice. Independent school are not required to participate in Public High School Choice.
6) Any student absent without an excuse for 10 consecutive school days will be removed from
the register on the 10th day and absences will no longer be counted. The school’s truant
office will be notified and expected to diligently investigate the whereabouts of the student.
The student’s enrollment will have an exit code of “status unknown” until the truancy
officer determines otherwise.

## CHAPTER TWO: THE ENROLLMENT RECORD

### 2.1 Overview

When a student enrolls in a school, the school is expected to record the student type to allow for
proper calculation of the Average Daily Membership. Section 2.1.1, titled “Admission Status”,
provides the complete list of student types. To meet the state and federal requirements for
continuous enrollment, a student must be given an enrollment classification at the beginning of
each school year and again on the day following the last day of the school year. Sections 2.1.
titled “Entry/Reentry Types” is a complete list of the required codes used at the beginning of the
year. Sections 2.2 describes exit codes and when and how to use each required code.
Information regarding part-time students is found in Section 2.3. Final classification codes are
described in Section 2.4.

### 2.1.1 Admission Status

When a student enrolls, a school is expected to record the student’s admission status to allow
for proper calculation of the ADM used in state funding and for creating reports on Vermont’s
public school students. Students included in the ADM calculation include regular students (01),
Public High School Choice students (02), home study students (04 & 05), students receiving
services at a school (07), and students enrolled but receiving services elsewhere (08 & 09). All
others are excluded from the ADM calculation. All students except home study students and
students receiving services are counted on a school’s enrollment. Admission Status codes are as
follows:

| Code | Description |
| -- | -- |
| 01 | Regular student : A student who meets all of the regular admission requirements of a school or an educational institution. This includes students tuitioned from other districts.
| 02 | Public High School Choice student: A high school student who meets all of the regular admission requirements of a school attending from another Vermont high school through Public High School Choice.
| 03 | Exchange student: A student from a country outside of the United States or its outlying areas who is temporarily enrolled in classes or a course of study at a school or educational institution in the United States.
| 04 | Home study student taking academic classes: A student who received home instruction and takes academic courses at a school. Academic courses include those courses that regular students receive academic credit for and that take place during normal school hours. Note: these students may or may not participate in extra- or co-curricular activities.
| 05 | Home study student participating in extra- or co-curricular activities only: A student who received home instruction and who participates in school sponsored extra- or co-curricular activities. These activities frequently take place outside of normal school hours and often last for only a portion of the school year. The school is not required to track attendance for these students. Do not include students attending an independent school and participating in extra- or co-curricular activities here.
| 06 | Guest student: A student attending a school or educational institution on a full-time basis other than the school of his or her regular enrollment without tuition payments. This includes children of teachers who live outside of the school district who attend the school as part of the teacher’s employee benefit plan.
| 07 | Student is receiving services at this school and enrolled in a different organization: A student taking courses or receiving other educational services at your school who is officially enrolled in a different school. 08 – Student is enrolled in this school but receiving services in a different organization: A student who is enrolled in your school is taking courses or receiving services from some other organization.
| 09 | HSCP student: A student enrolled at this school but attending the High School Completion Program.

### 2.1.2 Entry/Reentry Types

The enrollment classification must be indicated for all students on the first day of the school
year. Original entry (08, 09, or 10) will be used for students enrolled in the school where they
first entered the United States school system (usually as a preschool or kindergarten student).
Students who attended another school or who were withdrawn from school the previous
year will have an entry code indicating their prior situation. The following is a list of
entry/reentry codes to be used at the beginning of the school year or when a student enrolls
after the first day of school.

| Code | Description  |
| -- | -- |
| 01 | Transfer from a public school in Vermont, a designated public school, or Rivendell Academy: A student who transfers from a public school that is located in the state of Vermont, including Burr and Burton Academy, Lyndon Institute, St. Johnsbury Academy, and Thetford Academy or Rivendell Academy in Orford, NH.
| 02 | Transfer from and independent school in Vermont: A student who transfers from an independent school in Vermont. This does not include students transferring from Burr and Burton Academy, Lyndon Institute, St. Johnsbury Academy, and Thetford Academy.
| 03 | Transfer from a school in a different state or from a school outside of the country: A student who transfers from a public or private school that is located in a state outside Vermont, a public or private school that is located outside of the United States, or a United States overseas dependents school. See 09 and 10 for options related to foreign students.
| 04 | Transfer from an institution: A student who transfers from an institution with an educational program. This includes mental health institutions, correctional institutions, juvenile service agencies, care shelters, and detention facilities.
| 05 | Transfer from home study program: A student who transfers from a period of receiving instruction in a home environment (chosen for reasons other than health).
| 06 | Matriculation from another school: A student who enters a school after successful completion and promotion from the highest instructional level of another school to enter the next higher level.
| 07 | Re-entry after voluntary or involuntary withdrawal: A student who had previously entered any class in school and then re-enters the same or a different school after he or she has left school for voluntary reasons (e.g., dropping out) or involuntary reasons (e.g., prolonged illness, temporary disability) during a regular school session.
| 08 | Original entry into a United States school: A student already residing in the United States enters a school for the first time in the United States or an outlying area. This student is likely to be a preschool or kindergarten student.
| 09 |  Original entry into a United States school from a foreign county with no interruption in schooling: A student who has recently moved from a foreign country where he or she had been enrolled in school and enters a school in the United States or an outlying area for the first time.
| 10 | Original entry into a United States school from a foreign country with an interruption in schooling: A student who has recently moved from a foreign country where he or she has not been enrolled in school and enters a school in the United States or an outlying area for the first time.

### 2.2 Students who leave a school


The enrollment record must include information about students leaving a school. The
following sections describe the circumstances under which students leave school and
provide the exit codes for each situation. The enrollment record should include the Exit
Code and the last month, day, and year of an individual’s attendance in school; the Vertical
Reporting via the VT SLDS will instruct you to exit all students that have matriculated to the
next school/grade at the end of the school year to record an exit date of 06/30/XXXX day on
which an individual graduated or the date on which it becomes known officially that an
individual left school.

### 2.2.1 Students transferring to other educational programs


A student may be entered in more than one register in a given school or more than one
school in a district or the state during a school year but must only be officially enrolled in one
school register at a time. Each time a student is moved from one register to another, the first
register must show that the student transferred, and the new register must show that the
student reentered. The transfer codes indicate that a student has:

| Code | Description  |
| -- | -- |
| 01 | Transfer to a public school in Vermont: A student who transfers to a public school that is located within the state of Vermont or Burr and Burton Academy, Lyndon Institute, St. Johnsbury Academy, and Thetford Academy or Rivendell Academy in Orford, NH.
| 02 | Transfer to a Vermont Public school through Public High School Choice: A student who transfers to another Vermont High School through Public High School Choice.

| 06 | Transfer to home study program: A student who transfers to receiving instruction in a home environment (chosen for reasons other than health).
| 07 | Matriculation to another school: A student who enters another school after successful completion and promotion form the highest instructional level of the current school to the next higher level.

### 2.2.2 Students Counted as Dropout

A student who leaves school before completing the requirements for graduation and without
transferring to another educational program is considered a dropout.

A dropout can also be defined as a student who ceases to attend school and his or her residence
and school status is unknown. If a student does not officially leave school by indicating a
reason for transferring or dropping out, it is the school’s responsibility to account for the
student within 10 days of the student’s first day of absence. The school must determine if the
student is absent for a specific reason, has transferred, is receiving an approved alternate form
of instruction or has dropped out of the school system. Unless the student is absent and plans
to return to school, the appropriate exit code must be entered in the register. If the student’s
school status is unknown after the 10-day investigation period, the student must be recorded as
a dropout (15) “Absence/Status Unknown”. Students with the following exit codes are counted
as dropouts.

| Code | Description  |
| -- | -- |
| 14 | Discontinued Schooling: A student who stops attending school and the student does not intend to complete the requirements for a high school diploma.
| 15 | Absence/Status Unknown: A student who has been withdrawn due to 10 consecutive days of unexcused absence, status or location is unknown to the school or school district.
| 16 | Moved, not known to be continuing: A student who has moved outside his or her attendance area and is not known to be continuing his or her elementary or secondary education.
| 19 | Transfer to College Program: A student who has transferred to a college program resulting in a college degree without receiving a high school diploma. These students will be counted as non-graduates in the cohort graduation rate unless they re-enroll and receive a diploma after completing college coursework. In addition, these students will contribute to the annual event dropout rate.

### 2.2.3 Students Completing the Education

A student who has completed their program of study and does not intend to return to high
school should be recorded as such. Only students graduating with a regular diploma contribute
to a school’s graduation rate. The following exit codes apply to these students.

| Code | Description  |
| -- | -- |
| 08 | Graduated with regular diploma: A student who has received a regular high school diploma upon completion of state and local requirements or a high school diploma from a program other than the regular school program.
| 09 | Completed School with Other Credentials: A student who received a certificate of attendance, or other certificate of completion, in lieu of a diploma.

### 2.2.4 Codes for Other Reasons to Cease School Attendance

Students who officially leave school and transfer to another school or equivalent state-approved
education program are not dropouts. Students who are temporarily absent due to a suspension
or illness, or students who have died are also not considered dropouts. The AOE collect data
for the following categories that must be reported.

| Code | Description  |
| -- | -- |
| 11 | Death: A student whose membership is terminated because he or she died during or between regular school sessions.
| 12 | Illness: A student who left school for an indefinite period because of a physical, school approved illness.

Note: Federal rules on reporting students as a dropout are provided in Appendix C.

### 2.3 Part-time students

Part-time students are those students who attend classes at your school without taking a full
academic load. These students may or may not be officially enrolled in another school. Include
these students on the enrollment record and the attendance record because they may contribute
to their resident district’s Average Daily Membership and the school’s Allowable Tuition.

Students who are officially enrolled in another school (admission status 07) will not contribute
to the school’s enrollment (i.e., October 1 headcount). Part-time students who are not enrolled
elsewhere do contribute to the school’s enrollment.

### 2.4 Determining a Student’s Final Classification

A student’s classification is recorded separately from entry/reentry status. At the beginning of
the school year, the classification column is blank. The classification for an individual student
will change during or at the end of the school year. The enrollment record should include a
final classification for all students. The classification codes are listed below.

| Code | Name | Description  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| DE | **Deceased** | If a student dies during the school year, their exit type will be 11 and the final classification will be “DE”.
| DR | **Dropout** | A student is considered a dropout when he or she discontinues schools (exit 14), is absent for 10 consecutive school days with an unknown status (exit 15), moves and does not continue schooling (exit 16), transfers to a GED program Not operated by a Vermont publicschool (exit 18), or transfers to a college program (exit 19). For more information on dropouts see Appendix C.
| GC | **Graduated or Completed school** |  If a student finishes her or his program of study, he or she is classified as graduated or completed. Students will receive this classification upon receipt of a regular high school diploma (exit 08), or the receipt of a certificate of completion or a certificate of attendance (exit 09).
| NP | **Not Promoted** | If student’s grade level does not increase at the end of the school year (i.e., the student is retained).
| PR | **PR – Promoted: | If a student’s grade level increases during or at the end of the school year. This includes students who matriculate to another school after successful completion and promotion from the highest instructional level of the current school to the next higher level (exit 07).
| SD | **Summer Dropout** | A student who attended your school during the previous year who was expected to start classes at the beginning of this school year and who does not attend school on any of the first 10 days of classes without an excuse and is not known to be enrolled in any other educational program.
| TR | **Transfer:** | When pupils transfer from your school to another school or to an approved home study program, mark them as transfers (“TR”). This includes exit codes 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 or 06. If a transfer student re-enters your school during the current school year, you would begin a separate enrollment record with the appropriate entry/reentry code, begin tracking attendance form the beginning of the new enrollment and record the proper classification at the end of the subsequent enrollment period.
| NC | **No Category:** | When a student is on a school register but enrolled elsewhere (e.g., a home study student; admission status 07) no category at the end of the school year. In addition, a student who falls ill and withdraws from school would be included in this category (exit code 12). These students would not be included in the calculation of graduation or dropout rates.

## CHAPTER THREE: THE ATTENDANCE RECORD

### 3.1 Overview

The attendance record is a daily log of each enrolled student that shows who is present, and
who is absent (both excused and unexcused absences). The attendance record is also supporting
documentation for the enrollment record.

The record of attendance verifies a student’s continuous enrollment and participation in school.
Consequently, it is the school’s responsibility to monitor each student’s attendance by
investigating a student’s status within 10 days of the first date of absence.

### 3.2 General Attendance Rules and Requirements

1. A school is required to take attendance once per attendance day.
2. A day of attendance is defined as a day when the school is officially open, and the
    majority of students are recorded as in attendance.
3. A full-time kindergarten program records an attendance in the same manner as any
    other grade level (once daily). A part-time kindergarten program is one that does not
    provide educational services all day every day the school is officially open during the
    school year. To adequately calculate a Full-time Equivalent for students attending these
    programs, a part-time kindergarten program must record attendance for morning and
    afternoon sessions separately.
4. A student is either present or absent every day that the school is officially open, and he
    or she is not officially enrolled in another educational program.
5. A teacher, registrar or otherwise authorized person must record the attendance of each
    enrolled student in a school register each day that the school is in session.
6. Both excused and unexcused absences must be recorded in the register. An absence is
    considered excused when it meets the definition (see glossary). All other absences are
    unexcused.
7. A student receiving educational services at home (typically an EEE student) will be
    considered in attendance when those services are provided as expected. An absence is
    recorded if a scheduled meeting does not take place.
8. Students who are enrolled in your school but receiving educational services elsewhere
    are considered in attendance even on days when they are off campus. These students
    include but are not limited to a Page in legislature who does regular work assignments,
    a student in a work program that is part of the school day, students participating in off-
    site flexible pathways experiences under Act 77, a student spending required days in an
    evaluation program at the Baird Center, a student at a regional career technical center or
    a student in a hospital receiving tutoring.
9. A student officially enrolled elsewhere but taking courses at this school (e.g., a home
    study student taking academic classes) will be recorded in attendance on those days the
    student is expected to attend classes and absent on days that the student is expected but
    does not appear. Days that a part-time student is not expected in school are not counted
    as either an attendance or absence.

10. Do not record attendance for home study students who are not taking academic courses
    but participate in extra-curricular activities.
11. Each student’s attendance should be monitored so that a student is not absent for 10 or
    more consecutive school days without an investigation. The school must make a good
    faith effort to determine the reason for the absence or the student’s school status. A
    student who has been absent for 10 consecutive school days for an unknown reason
    must be reported as a dropout.
12. A student under an out-of-school suspension will remain on the enrollment record and
    absences recorded for each of the days the student is not attending classes.
13. A student who has been expelled from school will remain on the enrollment record and
    absences will be recorded for each of the days the student is not attending classes, except
    in the case where a school is providing educational services for the expelled student. In
    this case, the student will be recorded as in attendance but not in the building. If an
    expelled student enrolls in another school, he or she should be removed from the
    enrollment record with the appropriate exit code. If a previously expelled student does
    not return to school as expected and is absent for 10 consecutive school days the student
    is recorded as status unknown and counted as a dropout or summer dropout, whichever
    is most appropriate.

### 3.3 Instructions for Completing the Attendance Record

Schools are expected to use a computerized system for tracking student attendance. Note that
the Attendance record is not to be kept as part of the public record.

In your schools computerized information system provide a complete enrollment record for
each student expected to attend school, beginning with the first day of the school year (July 1).
Students entering after the first day of school must be added. Begin recording attendance and
absences on the first day of classes.

A pupil who begins attending your school after the first day the school is in session should only
have attendance and absences recorded beginning with the first day, they attended classes.

The school regular term begins on the first day students are expected to attend classes.

The attendance record must support the enrollment record. Each student receiving instructional
services in your school should be reflected in both the enrollment and attendance record.

For attendance, each organization must provide the following information.

- **SU/SD ID (ADMINID)** – The Supervisory Union/School District ID is a unique
    identifier assigned by the AOE for each entity in Vermont.

- **Absent Attendance Category (ABSCATID)** – A codeset value indicating the nature of
    an absence event, whether a student absence was excused or unexcused, the absence
    was a result of a disciplinary exclusion, or that the student was not expected to attend.

       **UA – Unexcused Absence**
       **SUS – Suspended**
       **EXP – Expelled**

- **Attendance or Absence Day Value (DSID_VALUE)** – A value indicating the
    proportional value of a day assigned for the instance of a student's reported daily
    attendance status. The options include:

## APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY................................................................................................................

### DEFINITION OF TERMS USED IN THE ELEMENTARY/SECONDARY SCHOOL

#### REGISTER

**Adult, With Diploma** - Students who are older than 19 years of age and who have received a
diploma. They have not enrolled in a regularly prescribed program of studies but are taking
classes specifically to develop skills and knowledge concerned with upgrading their interests
and abilities. They differ from Postgraduate students whose objective is to continue their formal
education. These students are now reported in the same grade level category with Postgraduate
students.

**Adult, Without Diploma** - Students who are older than 19 years of age and who HAVE NOT
received a diploma. These students are usually in a regularly prescribed program of study and
are working toward a high school diploma. This may also include students who have enrolled
in the Technical Centers specifically to upgrade their abilities in the area of employment.

**Approved Education Program** – A program that is evaluated and approved by the state board
pursuant to written standards, that is neither an approved independent school nor a public
school, and that provides educational services to one or more pupils in collaboration with the
pupil’s or pupils’ school district of residence. An “approved education program” includes an
“approved teen parent education program.”

**Average Daily Membership (ADM)** - ADM is the 20-day average of students between the 11th
and 30th days of the school year. The ADM is reported by resident district and is used in the
calculation of the equalized pupil count for school districts. Resident ADM differs from
"enrollment" in that it is based on where students live, while enrollment is a headcount of
students enrolled in school as of October 1 and is reported by school or operating school
district.

**Classification** - The classification for a student may change several times during the school
year; i.e., transferred to another school (TR), and then re-enters, etc. The final classification of a
student at the end of the year (or the end of a student’s enrollment during the year) is used in
calculating a school’s graduation and dropout rates.

**Co-Teacher of Record** - A teacher who shares the responsibility for ensuring the course
curriculum meets the standards required for the course.

**Course Section** - The course section is locally defined and can be any alpha-numeric code up to
20 characters, provided that the section is unique for a group of students in a classroom at a
particular time.

**Course Status Completed** – the student completed all course requirements prior to the end of
the school year

**Course Status Enrolled** – the student was still enrolled in the course at the end of the school
year (June 30, 20XX) and has not received a grade yet.


```
Elementary/Secondary School Register
Page 34 of 46
```
**Deceased** - Students who die during the school year or during the preceding summer.

**Dropout -**

**School Year** - Students who left school before graduating, who did not complete an approved
program of studies, and who did not transfer to another school or an approved home study
program during the period between September and June of this school year. Whenever a pupil
is absent from school without permission for more than 10 continuous days and the truant
officer, after a diligent search, certifies that the pupil has not enrolled in another prescribed
program of study, the pupil shall be removed from the register and classified as a dropout (DR).

**Summer** - Students who left school during the period between July 1st and the first day of the
current school year. These are students who finish the previous year's requirements but who do
not return to school in the fall and who do not transfer to another school or an approved home
study program; i.e., there is no transcript request. If the school is not notified that the student is
transferring before the beginning of classes, and the student doesn't attend school in the first 10
days, then he/she is considered a summer dropout and the final "classification" on Page A of the
Register of Daily Attendance & Absence would be "SD" (summer dropout). No attendances for

another school they continue to be a member of the school and counted as absent during the
expulsion period. These absences are considered excused, so the student isn’t counted as a
truant.

**Funding Source** - The person, group, or organizational entity paying for a student's educational
expenditures. These expenditures are typically paid by the student's resident district by
operating a school or paying tuition. However, a student's expenses may be covered by an

assume the responsibility for a non-resident, non-member student or the school district may be
given funding to pay for that student's educational expenses.

**Gender** - The physical and/or social condition of being male or female.

**Graded** - Students enrolled in the standard grade designations of Kindergarten and grades 1-12.

below grade 12 who have completed their program of studies and received a high school
diploma. Only students who have completed the state and local requirements for course work
and assessment and received a regular high school diploma are considered to have graduated.

**PLEASE NOTE:** If there are students in the 12th grade who have not met the graduation
requirements by June 30th, but who will have completed summer coursework or other
requirements after July 1st of this calendar year, their final classification for this school year is
“not promoted”. Since they will not graduate until after the beginning of next school year (after
July 1st), you will record them on the new school register and track their attendance during the
