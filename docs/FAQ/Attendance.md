# Attendance

[[_TOC_]]

## Can we do virtual Snow or Inclement Weather Days? How does attendance work for this?

See this memo released: [Clarification on Hybrid Learning Guidance for Inclement Weather Days](https://vermont.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d01e01e425fa1e66c26167761&id=c47cf894fc&e=c5a094cc7a)

## What Counts as an attendance event during virtual learning?

On each day for which attendance is recorded, an educator makes contact with the
student by video chat or telephone or the student logs into a Learning Management
System (LMS) and engages in learning activities (e.g., completes asynchronous
assignments, assessments, etc.);

## How should attendance be recorded during periods affected by COVID 19?​
