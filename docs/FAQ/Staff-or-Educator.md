## How do I deal with changed staff information? I had a staff record that worked last week, and this week it's not being accepted...

The names in the SLDS are based upon how they are listed in the online licensing system (ALiS) and are pulled once a week, typically Wednesday mornings after educator IDs are assigned to new registrants of ALiS. That data is used to create the Staff Master List which is uploaded into the SLDS the same morning.

Typically, changes in staff result from the above process. Staff can go into the licensing system and change their name at any time. You'll need to periodically sync up your data with the staff master list using the staff match data collection process.

If there’s ever a question on name anyone can search [the online licensing system.](https://alis.edlicensing.vermont.gov/login.aspx)

For this type of situation, a wild card – percent sign (%) – can be used in the last name field.

And click ‘Search’. This will provide you with how names are listed in the online licensing system.

Please note, this does not provide the educator ID, but will assist with the name so when a Staff Match is run, the SLDS should provide the ID in the output file.
