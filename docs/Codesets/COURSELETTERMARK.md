# COURSELETTERMARK

A codeset value indicating a meaningful alphabetical or categorical expression of performance of an individual in a course section. The codeset allows results to be expressed in different ranges of passing marks (e.g. A,B,C) and / or levels (e.g. A+, A, A-) or categories (e.g. Pass/Fail, levels of proficiency attainment).

## Notes

- Codes 25 through 29 can be used to accommodate proficiency based grading systems. 
- If no grade is awarded at the course level in proficiency based grading, do not average the mark, award the students a pass or Fail grade (codes 23,24)
