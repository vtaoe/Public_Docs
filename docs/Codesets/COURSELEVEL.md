| A      | Advanced: An advanced course designed for students who achieve a specified level of academic performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| B      | Basic or Remedial: A course focusing primarily on skills development. The course offered may focus on the improvement of a particular deficiency in content previously taught but not learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| E      | Enriched course: A course that augments the contents and/or rigor of a general course, but does not carry an honors distinction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| H      | Honors course: A course carrying an honors status according to educational requirements. These courses typically include additional content and/or a higher level of rigor than that found in general courses and they are formally designated as honors course                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| P      | Postsecondary: A course, often taken at or in conjunction with a postsecondary institution, which contains instruction equivalent to a college-level course and for which a student may earn college credits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| S      | Special Education Course When a special educator provides instruction in any of the core areas (i.e. English language arts/reading, math, science, and social studies) to one or more students in place of regular classroom instruction in that content area, including planning and assessment of student performance in the core area(s), the special educator is considered to provide primary instruction. The instruction may take place in the regular classroom or outside it. |
| X      | No Specified Rigor: The notion of rigor may not be appropriate for some courses at the elementary and middle levels; survey or interest courses that expose students to a variety of subjects are examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Z      | Alternative Education Course (An Alternative Program is a program in which students receive all or the majority of their instruction in one or more of the core areas of English Language Arts, Math, Science, or Social Studies in a program that is different from or separate from the regular school program. It can be a separately existing program housed in its own building, or it can be a single class in a high school.)                                                   |
