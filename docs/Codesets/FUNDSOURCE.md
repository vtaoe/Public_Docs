Funding Source

A codeset value indicating the person, group, or organizational entity paying for a student's educational expenditures.  These expenditures are typically paid by the student's resident district by operating a school, paying tuition, or paying union assessments.  However, a student's expenses may be covered by an alternative agreement between the school board and another party.  The school district may assume the responsibility for a non-resident, non-member student or the school district may be given funding to pay for that student's educational expenses.
